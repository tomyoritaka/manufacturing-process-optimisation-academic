## PROJECT: Defect and Cost Optimisation of a Manufacturing Process Using a Large Dataset
#### Project Context

This academic project requires analysis of a large dataset containing input variables and 2 output variables - a defect variable and a cost variable - of a new 4-step manufacturing process (each step has 4 input variables - Temperature, Vibration, Arc Gap and Pressure - as well as the aformentioned 2 output variables).

The numbers of defects & the costs of production are deemed too high. The defect numbers & the costs are also volatile - and seen to be uncontrollable. The new production line is seen as a 'black box'. 

The owner of the manufacturing process wants to make sense of the large dataset & to control/reduce the probabilities of defects & the costs of production going forward.

The CSV files are:
- CML_2023-09-11#7-machine_params_and_cost.csv
- CML_2023-09-11#6-Ion_Diffusion_Defects.csv
- CML_2023-09-11#5-crystalisation_Defects.csv
- CML_2023-09-11#4-contamination_defects.csv
- CML_2023-09-11#3-burnishing_Defects.csv

The objectives are:
1. From the existing dataset, identify the â€˜optimal' set(s) of M1-M4 (M1=Step 1, M2=Step 2, M3=Step 3, M4=Step 4) input variables that will meet particular defect
probability & cost requirements
2. Predict the defect probabilities & costs of a new set of M1-M4 input variables
