## PROJECT: Defect and Cost Optimisation of a Manufacturing Process Using a Large Dataset
#### Project Context

This academic project required analysis of a large dataset containing input variables and 2 output variables - a defect variable and a cost variable - of a 4-step manufacturing process (each step has 4 input variables - Temperature, Vibration, Arc Gap and Pressure - as well as the aformentioned 2 output variables).

The CSV files are:
- CML_2023-09-11#7-machine_params_and_cost.csv
- CML_2023-09-11#6-Ion_Diffusion_Defects.csv
- CML_2023-09-11#5-crystalisation_Defects.csv
- CML_2023-09-11#4-contamination_defects.csv
- CML_2023-09-11#3-burnishing_Defects.csv

The objectives are:
1. From the existing dataset, identify the â€˜optimal' set(s) of M1-M4 input variables that will meet particular defect
probability & cost requirements
2. Predict the defect probabilities & costs of a new set of M1-M4 input variables

#### Analysis and Results
